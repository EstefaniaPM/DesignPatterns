# Exercise: Baguette Shop
Creational Patterns - Factory Pattern

Description of the problem:

We have a baguette shop business. There are already known flavors with defined ingredients: Spanish, Italian, Mexican, Roman, among others. Among other things, a method of ordering baguette must create a baguette object and invoke its methods that are always the same prepare, bake, cut, box and return gabuette. Our method of ordering baguette must differentiate between the type of baguette that is requested and return the corresponding one. In addition, the business grows and we want many stores to adopt our system but considering regional differences. We need regional baguette factories that continue to prepare our known varieties but with the corresponding modifications. At least we have 4 stores Monterrey, Puebla, Yucatan and Guadalajara.
