Description of the problem:

Fox machine is a company that sells printers and gives discounts to customers.

Now Fox Machine asks you to develop a sales management system and design a scheme to calculate the discount when selling printers. Your design should be able to select the discount calculation flexibly (even selling the same type of printer). In addition, when they need a new discount calculation or want to modify old methods, it must be very easy and will not affect the existing system.
